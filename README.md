## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

Here is the screenshot for the mobile layout of the component

<img src="first-mobile.png" alt="Mobile layout" width="180px">

and the corresponding desktop layout.

<img src="first-desktop.png" alt="Desktop layout" width=700px>

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use a linear-gradient with both components of equal colour to add a colour on top of a background image.

```css
div {
  background-image: linear-gradient(colour, colour), url(image_url);
}
```

- This is my first time using SASS rather than strict CSS. The nesting feature of SASS is incredibly intuitive to me having come from a programming background. I shall definitely be using this from now on.

- That sometimes you are better off hardcoding the dimensions of elements, rather than always trying to use some relative measure.


### Continued development

I intend to continue with these HTML & CSS challenges, as I am starting to notice patterns in the challenges so far. Perhaps by the time I have finished another five or six challenges I will try to do some including JavaScript.
