# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

### Links

-   Live Site URL: [Netlify](https://jakegodsall-stats-preview-card.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   How to use a linear-gradient with both components of equal colour to add a colour on top of a background image.

```css
div {
    background-image: linear-gradient(colour, colour), url(image_url);
}
```

-   This is my first time using SASS rather than strict CSS. The nesting feature of SASS is incredibly intuitive to me having come from a programming background. I shall definitely be using this from now on.

-   That sometimes you are better off hardcoding the dimensions of elements, rather than always trying to use some relative measure.

### Continued development

I intend to continue with these HTML & CSS challenges, as I am starting to notice patterns in the challenges so far. Perhaps by the time I have finished another five or six challenges I will try to do some including JavaScript.
